# LightBlog

A lightweight blogging engine (very much a work in progress) written using loads of really cool things from other people.

 - [Slim framework](http://www.slimframework.com/)
 - [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/)
 - [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)
 - [PHP Markdown](http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/)
 - [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)

## Getting it via composer

Get composer, if you don't have it already:

    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    
Make a new project:

    php composer.phar create-project stewartml/lightblog [my project name] --repository-url http://github.com/stewartml/lightblog

Hack away.
